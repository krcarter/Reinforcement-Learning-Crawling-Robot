# Arduino Code

After learning was done generated trajectories to put on the real robot that the Arduino script pulled from. Try out the different gait behaviors. To create longer trajectories of more than 100 waypoints the Arduino Uno is going have to be upgraded to a different board.

## RL Crawl Gait vs Manual Crawl Gait
